# ANARI Examples

This directory contains example setups using ANARI. Each subdirectory demonstrates a unique rendering or visualization scene.

## Current Examples

### VTK Example - Cornell Box
The `vtk` subdirectory contains an example of rendering a Cornell box with ANARI-OSPRay.

#### Running the Example
Ensure dependencies for ANARI, ANARI-OSPRay, and VTK 9.4 are installed. Refer to the `examples/vtk/README.md` file for detailed instructions on running the Cornell box example.

## Future Examples
Additional ANARI examples will be added here, expanding on lighting, materials, and complex scene setups.
